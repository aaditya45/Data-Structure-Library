The Above project is completely build using c programming language. Complete Project contains of three directories (include , src , lib). 
All files in include directory contains header files in which methods and structures are declared which are later on defined in src directory 
and the ```c .lib``` file created after compiling the code is present in lib directory.<br>Project provides 4 type of data storing facility or 
data type to user i.e. stack ,linked list, queue and avlTree. All these four data types contains iteration feature which is a cherry on the top.
